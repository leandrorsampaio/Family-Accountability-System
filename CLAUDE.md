# Family Accountability System - Development Context

## Project Overview
A Flutter desktop application for managing family expenses with local SQLite database and encryption. The app operates completely offline and focuses on expense tracking with advanced categorization and reporting features.

## Technical Stack
- **Framework**: Flutter/Dart for desktop (macOS priority)
- **Database**: SQLite with sqflite_sqlcipher for AES-256 encryption
- **Storage**: Local database file (`database.db`) in executable directory
- **Security**: User-provided password for database encryption
- **Distribution**: Self-contained executable

## Key Features
1. **Expense Management**: Add, edit, delete expenses with detailed categorization
2. **Composite Items**: Break down complex purchases into sub-items
3. **User Management**: Multi-user support within family
4. **Advanced Filtering**: Date ranges, categories, tax-deductible status
5. **Reporting**: Generate reports based on various criteria
6. **Offline Operation**: No internet connectivity required

## Database Schema Summary
- `expenses`: Main expense records with categories, users, flags
- `composite_items`: Sub-items for detailed expense breakdowns  
- `categories`/`subcategories`: Hierarchical expense categorization
- `users`: Family members who can create expenses
- `user_configs`: App configuration and settings storage

## UI/UX Structure
- **Design**: Material Design with blueish color palette (configurable)
- **Layout**: Sidebar with month selection + main area with husband/wife tabs
- **Month Navigation**: All available months listed in left sidebar
- **User Tabs**: Husband and wife expense entries per selected month
- **Composite Items**: Checkbox to enable inline sub-item editing
- **Multi-Currency**: EUR default with support for additional currencies

## Initial Test Data
- 3 categories with 3 subcategories each for testing
- Sample: Food (Groceries, Restaurants, Snacks), Transport (Fuel, Public, Taxi), Utilities (Electric, Water, Internet)

## Security Requirements
- Database encryption at rest using AES-256
- Secure key management with flutter_secure_storage
- No data transmission (fully local)

## Development Commands
- `flutter run -d desktop`: Run app in desktop mode
- `flutter build windows/macos/linux`: Build for specific platform
- `flutter test`: Run unit tests
- `flutter analyze`: Static analysis

## Build & Distribution
- **Build Location**: `/Users/leandrorossisampaio/Desktop/FAS/`
- **Build Command**: `flutter build macos --release && cp -r build/macos/Build/Products/Release/family_accountability_system.app /Users/leandrorossisampaio/Desktop/FAS/`
- **App Size**: ~44MB (self-contained executable)
- **Database Storage**: Saved in the same FAS folder alongside the app (`/Users/leandrorossisampaio/Desktop/FAS/database.db`)

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for database operations
- Widget tests for UI components  
- Integration tests for complete workflows
- Platform-specific testing on Windows/macOS/Linux

## ðŸ“‹ IMPORTANT REQUIREMENTS
- **Project Documentation**: Always keep `projectOverview.md` updated whenever project structure, features, or architecture changes
- **File Tracking**: Document any new files, moved files, or structural changes in the overview
- **Feature Status**: Maintain current status of completed vs pending features
- **Architecture Notes**: Update architecture explanations when patterns or approaches change




## Writing Guidelines
### Core Principles (Zinsser Method)
**Brevity is power.** Strip every sentence to its cleanest components. Remove every word that serves no function. Replace phrases with
words. Choose simple words over complex ones.
### Clutter Elimination
- Cut qualifiers: "very",
"quite", "rather", "somewhat", "pretty much"
- Remove redundant pairs: "each and every",
"first and foremost",
"various and sundry"
- Eliminate throat-clearing: "It is important to note that", "The fact that"
- Avoid inflated phrases: Use "now" not "at this point in time"
- Delete meaningless jargon: "utilize" â†’ "use", "implement" - "do"
### Business Writing Rules
- Lead with the result, not the process
- Use active voice: "We fixed the bug" not "The bug was fixed"
- Write for the reader who knows nothing about your work
- State conclusions first, then explain if needed
- One idea per sentence, one topic per paragraph
### Technical Documentation
- Start with what it does, not how it works
- Use concrete examples over abstract descriptions
- Write instructions as commands: "Run tests" not "You should run tests"
- Assume intelligence but not knowledge
- Test your writing: Can someone follow it without you there?
*## Code-Related Writing
- Variable names are sentences: make them clear, not clever
- Error messages
should tell users what to do next
- Documentation should answer "why", code shows "what"
- PR descriptions: State changes and impacts, skip the journey
- Commit messages: What changed and why, in present tense
### The Zinsser Test
Before committing any written text, ask:
1. Can I cut this sentence in half?
2. Is there a simpler word?
3. Does the reader need to know this?
4. Am I saying this twice?
Remember: Clear writing is clear thinking. If you can't write it simply, you don't understand it well enough.
